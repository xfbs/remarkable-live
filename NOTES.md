# Notes

## Setup SSH

To find out how to connect to your remarkable, go into Settings -> About. On
the right hand side, under *GPLv3 Compliance*, is a little note containing
information of the current IP address and root password of your device.

I used this to connect to my device, copy my `id_rsa.pub` file over into
`/root/.ssh/authorized_keys`, and made sure to fix permissions. Then I added an
entry into my local `~/.ssh/config` to let me connect to my device easily.

```ssh
Host remarkable
    HostName 192.168.1.140
    User root
```

Like this, I can connect to it simply with the following.

    ssh remarkable

## Getting an image off the device

It is possible to read the contents of the screen simply by reading from the
frame buffer file `/dev/fb0`.

    cat /dev/fb0 > framebuffer
    scp remarkable:/home/root/framebuffer .

It is possible to get information about the framebuffer from the sysfs.

    $ cat /sys/class/graphics/fb0/virtual_size
    1408,3840
    $ cat /sys/class/graphics/fb0/bits_per_pixel
    16

With this information, I can analyse the framebuffer image I got off the device. The framebuffer image I got off it has a size of 10813440 bytes.

    $ ls -la framebuffer
    -rw-r--r--  1 pelsen  staff  10813440 Oct 18 18:14 framebuffer

The framebuffer presents itself with a virtual size of 1408 by 3840, and with 2 bytes (16 bits) per pixel, that sounds about right.

Turns out I can throw away half of that data, as the framebuffer is twice as
big as it needs be (which is why it is so ridiculously high). I can also
convert it from using two bytes per pixel to one â€” I'm not exactly sure what is
kept in the other half, but it appears that I don't need it.

I wrote some tools that can be used for working with the framebuffer. The
`fbtopng` script takes a raw framebuffer and converts it to a PNG image on
stdout. The `compress` script reads a framebuffer, spitting out only the 8
lower 8 pixel bits and cutting off the second half of the image (that isn't
used). The `fb8topng` tool takes the output of the `compress` tool and turns it
into a PNG image.

Compiling the `compress` tool and running it on the reMarkable shows that it
still is too slow to be useful, the raw reading is so slow that I can only get
9 frames per second. My idea is to rewrite it using `mmap`, which might be
faster.
